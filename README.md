**GoDraw** is a free, open-source, and feature-rich digital whiteboard built with love in India. It serves as a powerful alternative to popular tools like **Excalidraw**, **tldraw**, and **Miro**, with the mission to provide a fast, reliable, and accessible tool for students, teachers, designers, and teams everywhere.

Our goal is to create a world-class collaborative tool that is both powerful for professionals and simple for everyday use.
